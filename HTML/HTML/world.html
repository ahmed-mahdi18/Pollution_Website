          <h2>HOW MUCH PLASTIC DOES THE WORLD PRODUCE?</h2>
          <p>Humans have produced about 8 billion tons of plastic since 1950, and more than half of it went straight to landfills. Of all of the plastic that's no longer in use, only about 9% was actually recycled.</p>
          
          <p>The average American tossed out about 12 ounces of plastic each day in 2010, the equivalent of about 26 average-size water bottles.</p>
					<p>If that seems like a lot, it is. High-income countries tend to generate more plastic waste per person, according to a report on plastic pollution by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser of Our World in Data. But while high-income countries usually have well-managed waste streams and therefore lower levels of plastic pollution to external environments, plastic waste still enters rivers and oceans, especially from coastal populations (defined as within 50 kilometers of a coastline.) </p>
					<p>In 2018, the global production of plastics reached 359 million metric tons, with 62 million metric tons produced in Europe alone. China is one of the largest producers of plastics in the world, accounting for more than one quarter of the global production.</p>

    <div class="text">Plastic does not only ruin our landscape and enviroment it is also one of the causes of climate change. As you can see in the picture about 4% of annual total of use of oils and gases are for plastic production only which is mind-boggling.</div>
