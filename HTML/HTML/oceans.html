          <h2>OUR OCEANS ARE DYING!</h2>
          <p>We are turning our beautiful Ocean into a plastic soup. About 8 million tonnes of plastic enters the sea every year, and at this rate we face a future with more plastic in the Ocean than fish by 2050. Our plastic addiction and waste mismanagement is condemning countless marine birds and animals to death by entanglement or poisoning, and even leading to chemical contamination of the fish we eat.
</p>
						<p>In the ocean, plastic pollution impacts sea turtles, whales, seabirds, fish, coral reefs, and countless other marine species and habitats. In fact, scientists estimate that more than half of the world's sea turtles and nearly every seabird on Earth have eaten plastic in their lifetimes.
</p>
          <p>In addition to the risks from polluted marine waters, ingestion of plastic by fish and other marine beings also in-turn causes harm to people who consume marine food.Studies have found that toxins in plastics cause several of health issues including cancers, immune system problems, and birth defects.</p>
          
					<p>here is a video showing us the extent of plastic polltion in the oceans:</p>

					<h2>How does plastic get into the sea?</h2>
					<p>
					You see photos of plastic waste in the sea, but it can be hard to connect that to the plastic you're buying and using every day.
					There are three main ways the plastic we use every day ends up in the oceans.<br>
					<p><strong>1.Throwing plastic in the bin when it could be recycled:</strong><br>
Plastic you put in the bin ends up in landfill. When rubbish is being transported to landfill, plastic is often blown away because it’s so lightweight. From there, it can eventually clutter around drains and enter rivers and the sea this way.</p>
<p><strong>2.Littering:</strong><br>
Litter dropped on the street doesn’t stay there. Rainwater and wind carries plastic waste into streams and rivers, and through drains. Drains lead to the ocean!

Careless and improper waste disposal is also a big contributor – illegal dumping of waste adds greatly to the plastic surge in our seas.</p>
<p><strong>3.Products that go down the drain:</strong><br>
Many of the products we use daily are flushed down toilets, including wet wipes, cotton buds and sanitary products. Microfibres are even released into waterways when we wash our clothes in the washing machine. They are too small to be filtered out by waste water plants and end up being consumed by small marine species, eventually even ending up in our food chain.

A positive move in recent months was a ban on microbeads in rinse-off cosmetic and cleaning products introduced by the UK Government, so that these small plastic beads will no longer get washed down the sink and out into our oceans, but there are many more items that can also contribute to the problem.</p>
