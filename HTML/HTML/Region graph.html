          <h2><strong>In the chart we see the global distribution of mismanaged plastic waste aggregated by world region. </strong></h2>
      
        <p> The East Asia and Pacific region dominates global mismanaged plastic waste, accounting for 60 percent of the world total.</p>
					<p>There is a wide gap between East Asia and the other regions â€” South Asia ranks second but contributes around 5 times less with 11 percent of the total. This is followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (9 percent); Middle East & North Africa (8.3 percent); Latin America (7.2 percent); Europe and Central Asia (3.6 percent) and North America (1 percent).</p>
					<p>whilst countries across North America and Europe generate significant quantities of plastic waste (particularly on a per capita basis), well-managed waste streams mean that very little of this is at risk of ocean pollution. In fact, if North America & Europe were to completely eliminate plastic use, global mismanaged plastic would decline by less than 5 percent.</p>
