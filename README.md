# Pollution_Website
this is a Website i made for a LC project analysing the plastic pollution in the world by getting large sets of data in excel form and writing a python program to turn that into a 
graph, then taking those graphs and doing research to put it all into a one final website with all the information. i wrote a JavaScript program to connect the website to a firebase so when someone inputs data into the contacts form it is easier to be analysed and be seen.
